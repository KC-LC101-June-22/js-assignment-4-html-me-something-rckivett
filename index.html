      <p id="testP" class="funParagraph">Salutations!  My name is Ryan Kivett and I'm here to tell you a bit about the past 11 years of my life.  Back in 2011, I married Jessica and we began our journey together.</p>
      <p>In July, we had our honeymoon and went to Glacier National Park.  Neither of us had been to the park before and it was our first major trip together where it was just us.<p>

      <p>We actually started off living apart from each other as when we got married, she lived in Manhattan, KS and I lived in Independence, MO.  She had a house in Manhattan where I only had an apartment and she had a better paying job than I did.  It made the most sense for me to move to Manhattan, but I couldn't find a job.</p>
      <p>In August of that year, I quit my job and moved out to Kansas and in March, I began work at a landscaping company before finding a more permanant job at the City of Manhattan as a Zoning Insepction Officer.</p>
      <p>Now, Jessica already had a cat when we got married; a black cat named Flower.  I, however, had never had a cat before and I thought it would be fun to get a cat.  I decided that I wanted a tuxedo cat and I found a fostered cat in town and brought him home. I named him Domino.</p>

      <p>Fast forward a few years and in the summer of 2014, we find out that we're expecting a baby boy.  Both of us had never really taken care of kids before so we had no idea what to expect.  Then, on 07 March 2022, our baby boy arrived and I held him for the first time.</p>

      <p>A couple of months later, at the very beginning of May, Jessica accepted a job at the Univeristy of Arkansas System Division of Agriculture as the Facility Manager of the Harry R. Rosen Alternative Pest Control Center.  She would start in a few short weeks.  I had to immediately quit my job and then we had the arduous task of driving to Arkansas, finding a place to live, and then moving our 3 bedroom house with a garage into a 2 bedroom apartment in Fayetteville, Arkansas.  I'm still not sure how we managed to pull it off, but we did.  We ended up living in our apartment: 2 adults, 1 baby, and 2 cats. It was an absolute trip.</p>
      <p>Fortunately, in February of 2016, we purchased our current home and moved in at the end of February into the beginning of March.  It felt like a lot of space for our group, but we managed to make it work.  We now had 4 bedrooms, 2 bathrooms, a two car garage, and a yard on a 1/3 acre property on the west side of Fayetteville.  I didn't have a job yet so I stayed at home with Caleb and took care of him.  He and I spent a lot of time together over the next year and a half, but we eventually decided that I should probably find a job and Caleb would start daycare.  While at a work party, I was asked what it was that I had wanted to do.  Up until this point, most of my jobs had always involved enforcement of some kind.  I had worked as a construction materials tester at Terracon.  I had worked as a Environmental Specialist at the Missouri Department of Natural Resources.  I had been a Zoning Inspector.  I wasn't a huge fan of the direction that my career path so I told them that I don't know what I want to do, but I know what I don't want to do.  One of the guys at the party that I was standing beside looked at me and asked me if I had any experience in technology.  I didn't really but he told me to send him my resume as they were hiring an hourly position and could train me a bit.  I sent in my resume and was approved to work as an hourly employee at the University of Arkansas System Division of Agriculture in the IT group.  IT wasn't enforcement, so I was excited to see how things would go.</p>
      <p>I continued to work as an hourly and picked up a lot of understanding as to how to do tech work.  I learned how to create and deploy Windows images, configure computers, install network printers, troubleshoot issues, and a variety of other things.  While being an hourly in 2018, Jessica and I welcomed home our second baby, Michaela, and the following year, I was hired on full time as the helpdesk manager.</p>

      <p>I've continued as the heldpesk manager and have only picked up more skills.  On top of doing general desktop support both in person and remotely, I now also am also responsible for creating new user accounts, resetting user MFA, sending out Division wide emails in accordance with our standard protocols, and making sure tasks are being completed in a reasonable time.</p>
      <p>Now, as we await for our third child, a little boy, we look to our family story and wonder what additional chapters will be added as we continue into the future.</p>
